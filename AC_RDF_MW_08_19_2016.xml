        <dcterms:abstract xml:lang="en">Objective: We tested the efficacy of a group-based
            traditional and multimedia HIV/STI prevention intervention (Project WORTH: Women on the
            Road to Health) among drug-involved women under community supervision. Design, Setting,
            Participants, and Intervention: We randomized 306 women recruited from community
            supervision settings to receive either: (1) a four-session traditional group-based
            HIV/STI prevention intervention (traditional WORTH); (2) a four-session multimedia
            group-based HIV/STI prevention intervention that covered the same content as traditional
            WORTH but was delivered in a computerized format; or (3) a four-session group-based
            Wellness Promotion intervention that served as an attention control condition. The study
            examined whether the traditional or multimedia WORTH intervention was more efficacious
            in reducing risks when compared to Wellness Promotion; and whether multimedia WORTH was
            more efficacious in reducing risks when compared to traditional WORTH. Main Outcomes and
            Measures: Primary outcomes were assessed over the 12-month post-intervention period and
            included the number of unprotected sex acts, the proportion of protected sex acts, and
            consistent condom use. At baseline, 77% of participants reported unprotected vaginal or
            anal sex (n = 237) and 63% (n = 194) had multiple sex partners. Results: Women assigned
            to traditional or multimedia WORTH were significantly more likely than women assigned to
            the control condition to report an increase in the proportion of protected sex acts
            (&#946; = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.02&#8211;0.18) and a decrease in the number of unprotected
            sex acts (IRR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.57&#8211;0.90). Conclusion and Relevance: The promising
            effects of traditional and multimedia WORTH on increasing condom use and high
            participation rates suggest that WORTH may be scaled up to redress the concentrated
            epidemics of HIV/STIs among drug-involved women in the criminal justice
            system.</dcterms:abstract>
