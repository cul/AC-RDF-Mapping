# AC-RDF-Mapping

Mapping of MODS metadata into a set of RDF properties.

Initial goals:
- provide examples of MODS records converted to an RDF/XML serialization
- provide an "AC ontology" in RDF/OWL (serialized in XML)

###AC Ontology
Created with Protege, in this stage ot probably violates millions of ontology development principles.
Two versions will be available:
- ac-light (ac.owl)
- ac-full (ac-full.owl) 
[documentation still pending]

###Examples:
